==============================

Templates &amp; Bootstraps for developing on the Buddy Media Platform.

Uses
-----

Boilerplate and template CSS to make developing on the platform easier. Also includes some common .js we include just to clean up some of the code. 

Adding .js to platform
----------------------

Adding .js to platform is simple. Just add an HTML sapplet to the tab and put your code in. Jquery is already loaded, so don't load that. Then, just hide the sapplet with CSS. Our boilerplate include `#mod_js` &amp; `#mod_hide` as standard hide IDs.
