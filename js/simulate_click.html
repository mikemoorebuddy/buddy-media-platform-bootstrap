<!-- this will initiate clicking of an item on a tab that you need.
     i used this to have a photogallery load a certain photo in the
     thumbs rather than the first. in the example the client wanted to
     be able to show a different thumb by default for a certain day.
     you could also use this to really click anything you need in order
     to load something different than the default etc  -->

<script>
     $(function() {
          setTimeout(function() {
               $("#bm_id4eaacd2536f98_thumb_4eaaf2ebe935d a").click()
          },900);
     });
</script>

<!-- another example of this where you want the share dialog to open when you click on a Post to Wall item -->
<script>
     $(function(){
          $('.item', '#mod_ptw').click(function() {
              var t = setTimeout(function() {
                  $('.bmButton', '#posttowall_share').click();
              }, 160);
          });
     });
</script>
